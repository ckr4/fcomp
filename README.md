# This is a shiny app to compare the null and alternative hypotheses when testing multiple means.
# It provides a graphic representation of how the distributions overlap according to the number 
# of treatments, number of samples per treatment, means of the treatments, and the overall
# variance. It also displays the areas corresponding to Type I and II errors and calculates the
# Beta and Power of the experiment.

# The app is hosted online at http://3ogq5s-chad-kite.shinyapps.io/fcomp-app and can also be run
# from the console in Rstudio with the command: runGitHub('ckr4/fcomp').
